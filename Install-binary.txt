
Installing Cuyahoga from the binary distribution

1. Requirements
    - IIS 5.0 or higher
    - The .NET 1.1 or 2.0 runtime environment. Mono users have to use the source distribution.
    - A database server. Supported databases are
        - SQL Server/MSDE 2000 and 2005
        - PostgreSQL 7.4 and higher
        - MySQL 4.0 and higher
        
2. Extract the files to a directory on your local machine.

3. Create an empty database.

4. Change the connection string in the Web\Config\properties.config (connectionString)
   to the database that is created in step 3.
		  
    Example (SQL Server):
    <connectionString>server=(local);database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;</connectionString>
          
    Example (PostgreSQL):
    <connectionString>server=192.168.0.1;port=5432;database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;</connectionString>
          
    Make sure that the account that connects to the database has enough permissions to create
    the database!
    
5. Create a website or a virtual directory in IIS and set its home directory to the physical 
    directory where the Cuyahoga files were extracted.
    
6. You are now ready to run the application. Open your browser and navigate to the site or virtual
    directory that is created in the previous step.

    At the first visit, the database will be installed automatically, and you'll be asked to set 
    a password for the administrator (min. 5 characters!). After that there is an option to
    create a sample site. When everything is finished you can visit the web site adminstration
    pages. The url of the web site administration is 
    http://SERVER_NAME/VIRTUAL_DIRECTORY/Admin/. If you installed Cuyahoga in the cuyahoga 
    virtual directory on your localhost, this url will be http://localhost/cuyahoga/Admin/.

    The following steps are only required when no sample site is installed.
    
    In the web site administration, the first thing to do is creating a site. Make sure that the
    site url that you enter, corresponds with the real site url, including the virtual directory
    (for example, http://localhost/cuyahoga).
    When a site is created you can start adding pages (nodes) and sections. Just give it a try 
    and when something isn't clear, check the forums at http://www.cuyahoga-project.org/home/forum.aspx.
    
    
Hints and tips:

- It's possible run the database install scripts manually if the installation fails for some
  reason. They are located in the /Install/Database directory.
- The search index has to be in a folder that is writable for the ASP.NET user. You can specify the
  folder in the web.config:

  <CuyahogaSettings>
    ...
    <add setting="SearchIndexDir" value="~/index" />
    <add setting="InstantIndexing" value="true" /> <!-- true/false -->
  </CuyahogaSettings>

  InstantIndexing indicates that when you edit the content of a module that is searchable, the
  search index will be updated immediately. If you turn this off, you have to manually index the
  content from the Administration section.
  
- You can enable logging to uncomment the <log4net> section in the Web.config. Make sure your
  ASP.NET user has write access to the path of the logfile.
- Give the ASP.NET user write access for the Web/UserFiles directory to enable uploading images or
  other files with the FCKEditor from the StaticHtml and Articles modules.
- Give the ASP.NET user write access for the Web/files directory to enable uploading files with
  the Downloads module. You can optionally enter a physical path for the location where the files
  should be uploaded. With this, it is possible to keep the files out of the web site to prevent 
  direct downloading.
