From version 1.5.0, Cuyahoga requires the .NET 2.0 Framework.
**************************************************************

Installing Cuyahoga from source.

1. Unzip the files to a local directory.

2. Create a database. Supported databases are:
    - SQL Server 2000 / SQL Server 2005 / SQL Server Express / MSDE 2000 
    - PostgreSQL 7.4 and higher
    - MySQL 4.0 and higher

3. Build and run.

    There are 2 possible ways to build Cuyahoga: using Visual Studio .NET 2005 (VS.NET) or NAnt.
    
    3a. Building with VS.NET.
        - Make sure that you have VS.NET 2005 SP1 or that you have installed the Web Application
          Project model (http://webproject.scottgu.com/).
        - Open Cuyahoga.sln with VS.NET.
        - Build Solution.
        - Change the connection string in Web/Config/properties.config (connectionString)
          to the database that is created in step 2.
		  
          Example (SQL Server):
		  <connectionString>server=(local);database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;</connectionString>
          
          Example (PostgreSQL):
		  <connectionString>server=192.168.0.1;port=5432;database=Cuyahoga;uid=***;pwd=***;</connectionString>
          
          Make sure that the account that connects to the database for the first time has enough 
          permissions to create the database!
                    
    3b. Building with NAnt.
        - Make sure you have a 0.85 version of NAnt (http://nant.sourceforge.net).
        - Open a command prompt, go to the directory where you extracted the .zip file.
        - Enter 'nant'. This will create a build directory with the compiled binaries and the 
          libraries (for example 'build/net-2.0/debug').
        - Enter 'nant deploy' to add the other files needed to run Cuyahoga to the build.
        - Create an IIS application that points to the build directory or copy the files in the
          build directory to the root directory of an existing IIS application.
        - Change the connection string in the Web/Config/properties.config (connectionString)
          to the database that is created in step 2. See 3a for example connection strings.
          
    You are now ready to run the application. At the first visit, the database will be installed automatically, 
    and you'll be asked to set a password for the administrator (min. 5 characters!). 
    After that there is a choice to install additional modules and to create a sample site. 
    When everything is finished you can visit the web site adminstration pages. The url of the 
    web site administration is http://SERVER_NAME/VIRTUAL_DIRECTORY/Admin/. 
    If you installed Cuyahoga in the cuyahoga virtual directory on your localhost, this url will be 
    http://localhost/cuyahoga/Admin/.

    The following steps are only required when no sample site is installed.
    
    In the web site administration, the first thing to do is creating a site. Make sure that the
    site url that you enter, corresponds with the real site url, including the virtual directory
    (for example, http://localhost/cuyahoga).
    When a site is created you can start adding pages (nodes) and sections. Just give it a try 
    and when something isn't clear, check the forums at http://www.cuyahoga-project.org/home/forum.aspx.
    
Hints and tips:
- It's possible run the database install scripts manually if the installation fails for some
  reason. They are located in the /Web/Install/Database directory.
- The search index has to be in a folder that is writable for the ASP.NET user. You can specify the
  folder in the web.config:

  <CuyahogaSettings>
    ...
    <add setting="SearchIndexDir" value="~/index" />
    <add setting="InstantIndexing" value="true" /> <!-- true/false -->
  </CuyahogaSettings>

  InstantIndexing indicates that when you edit the content of a module that is searchable, the
  search index will be updated immediately. If you turn this off, you have to manually index the
  content from the Administration section.
  
- You can enable logging to uncomment the <log4net> section in the Web.config. Make sure your
  ASP.NET user has write access to the path of the logfile.
- Give the ASP.NET user write access for the Web/UserFiles directory to enable uploading images or
  other files with the FCKEditor from the StaticHtml and Articles modules.
- Give the ASP.NET user write access for the Web/files directory to enable uploading files with
  the Downloads module. You can optionally enter a physical path for the location where the files
  should be uploaded. With this, it is possible to keep the files out of the web site to prevent 
  direct downloading.
